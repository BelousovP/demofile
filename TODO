TypeScript TODO:

- [x] Check all .emit have a corresponding .on declaration
- [x] Move all event comments to the .on declarations
- [x] Remove 'module.exports'
- [x] Create 'Networkable' which is the base type of BaseEntity.
      BaseEntity should only be used if the entity has DT_BaseEntity
- [x] Reading strings need to trim NULL
- [ ] Search for 'as unknown' and comment each case
